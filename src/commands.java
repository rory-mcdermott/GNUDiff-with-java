//This program shows how to execute a command using your operating system, like Windows or Mac.
// Notice that in this program when the program execute the command, we catch the output
//    on the command line and save it (BufferedReader b). You can use that to print the output
//   on java terminal, or you might write the data to a file, like a patch file, or you might
//   write some of it to an XML file. This is just a general framework for you to use.

// I am executing a diff command, print the output, and save the output of diff in string called output and write it to a file.
